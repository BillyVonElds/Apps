I've created a comprehensive Golf Shot Distance Calculator that estimates both the north-south distance and east-west deviation based on the nine input factors you specified.
How the Calculator Works
The application processes these key factors affecting golf ball flight:

Base Distance: The starting point distance under ideal conditions
Altitude: Increases distance (~2% per 1,000 feet elevation)
Wind: Affects both distance and lateral movement based on speed and direction
Lie Angle: Steeper angles reduce distance due to increased launch angle -- positive = uphill lie; negative = downhill lie
Surface Type: Different surfaces affect both distance and ball control
Slope Change: Uphill/downhill elevation changes impact distance
Temperature: Warmer temperatures generally increase distance
Humidity: Higher humidity slightly increases distance due to less air resistance

Key Calculations

Altitude Effect: ~2% increase in distance per 1,000 feet of elevation
Wind Effect: Vector decomposition for both distance and lateral effects
Temperature Effect: ~2 yards per 10°F change from 70°F baseline
Lie Surface Penalties: Progressive distance reductions from fairway to rough to sand/mud
Slope Impact: ~1.5% change in distance for every 10 feet of elevation change

Using the Calculator

Enter your baseline distance and the environmental/course conditions
The calculator assumes every shot is hit due North, so wind direction should be calibrated relative to that (i.e., "North" is actually a tailwind, and "South" is actually a headwind.
Click "Calculate Distance"
View the estimated "north" distance (i.e., how far straight) and "east/west" deviation; positive = east/right, negative = west/left
Check the detailed breakdown showing the effect of each factor

The application provides both the final results and a detailed breakdown of how each factor contributed to the outcome, helping golfers better understand their shot dynamics.
